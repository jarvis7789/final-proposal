    <title>Race Pace Calculator - Update (12/5) </title>
<body>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>The goal of this is to be able for someone to enter a 
        distance that they are racing, like a 5k or 2 miles, and the goal time they watching
        to run, and have it spit out the pace you need to go at for different distances like
        pace per mile or pace per 400 meters. The application would also work the other way,
        where you input a pace, and it will spit out a time. In longer races, the hundreths 
        or seconds matter a lot so I will make sure that they get accounted for.
    </p>
    <h2>Tech</h2>
    <p>The language i will use will be java. I think I kind of want to do something like we 
        did with the web matchmaker with drop down bars and calculations like we did. Then
        I wont have to validate anything and it will be more accessable as well. I will also 
        base it off of what was done with the risk calculator. That was somewhat of what I 
        has in mind doing but with distances and times.
